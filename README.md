# Artificial Intelligence Course Outline

## Course Description
This course provides students with the main fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The course covers the main techniques that are used in AI examples (from chess-playing to self-driving cars). These techniques include search algorithms, probability, reasoning and inference, programming logic, expert systems, rule-based systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning, knowledge representation, pattern recognition, and natural language processing. The course helps students to use AI to solve specific problems in their future careers. The theoretical part of the course focuses on understanding concepts, structures, and algorithms, while the practical part (lab) includes a set of exercises to be performed using AI tools such as CLIPS, Weka, and Matlab.
